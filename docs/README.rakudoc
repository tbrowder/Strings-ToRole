=head1 NAME

B<Strings::ToRole> - Creates a file defining a named 'role' from a list of strings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use Strings::ToRole;
my @s = [
    attr1 value1 # value1 is a string
    attr2 32     # Numeric

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Strings::ToRole> produces a text file that can be used to
define a Raku named C<role> so a using Raku C<class> 
can be instantiated with it.

NOTE: I<The generated role file, when used by a class,
gets compiled into usable class member BEFORE the class
is constructed, so the role's attributes and methods can be 
used to complete the construction of the using class.>

=head2 The role file

The text file defining the role looks like this:

=begin code
=end code

=head2 The class file

That file then can be used to provide data to
define a Raku C<class> by doing this:

=begin code 
# insert code from file "myrole.txt" here...
class MyClass does MyRole is export {
   # more code that uses the data in the role MyRole
   # ...
}
=end code

The user is free to crreate a collection of useful role
files to mix and match to define other useful classes.
